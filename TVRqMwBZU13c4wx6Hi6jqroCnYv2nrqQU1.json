	"description": "TGOLDe stands for Tron Gold Energy. Similar as BTC using real electric power for mining,️ TGOLDe use TRON Energy for mining. In Physics, Power = Energy / Time. On Tron, TGOLDe is mined using Energy per transaction. Thus, TGOLDe = POWER；which means TGOLDe users mine TGOLDe tokens by using tron transaction energy.",
